Project Title: Quizify: Leveraging NLP Techniques

Project Description:

The Advanced Quiz Generator project aims to develop a comprehensive toolset for generating assessment questions, including multiple-choice questions (MCQs), true/false questions, fill-in-the-blanks, and match-the-following questions, using state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The project will utilize Python programming, data structures, deep learning principles, and basic familiarity with Pytorch to implement various algorithms and models.

The primary focus of this project is to bridge the gap between educational content and assessment generation through the application of cutting-edge NLP methodologies. By analyzing middle school textbook content, the project aims to automate the creation of diverse and high-quality assessment questions, thereby enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of educational platforms.

Key Features:

1. Distractor Generation for MCQs: Implement algorithms such as ```Wordnet```, ```ConceptNet```, and ```Sense2vec``` to generate plausible distractors for multiple-choice questions.

2. True/False Question Generation: Utilize pre-trained models like ```sentence BERT```, ```constituency parser```, and ```OpenAI GPT-2``` to generate true/false questions with alternate endings.

3. MCQ Generation from Text: Train a ```T5 transformer model``` using the HuggingFace library to generate multiple-choice questions from textual content.

4. Fill-in-the-Blanks Question Generation: Extract keywords using Python Keyword extraction library, perform fast keyword matching with the flashtext library, and visualize fill-in-the-blanks questions using HTML ElementTree in Colab.

5. Match-the-Following Question Generation: Extract keywords, perform keyword matching, and utilize ```BERT for word sense disambiguation``` to generate match-the-following questions.

6. Deployment to Production: Deploy transformer models like T5 to production in a serverless fashion by converting them to ONNX format, performing quantization, and creating lightweight Docker containers using FastAPI for deployment on platforms like Google Cloud Run.

Prerequisites:

- Strong Python programming skills.
- Basic knowledge of Natural Language Processing and Pytorch.
- Understanding of deep learning concepts like forward pass, backpropagation, optimizers, and loss functions.

The project will be accompanied by easy-to-use Google Colab notebooks, allowing users to access and run the code seamlessly on the cloud. Additionally, the project will leverage popular NLP libraries such as Spacy, NLTK, AllenNLP, and HuggingFace transformers for efficient implementation of algorithms and models.

Overall, the Advanced Quiz Generator project will provide a practical demonstration of NLP techniques applied to question generation in educational contexts, offering learners the opportunity to gain hands-on experience with cutting-edge methodologies and tools.
